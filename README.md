# SOCKS5-proxy
This proxy.sh allows you to connect to an external server eg. Google Cloud VM to bypass the IPS/School website restrictions

You might encounter issue with Google Chrome on MacOS, as it doesn't obey the system proxy settings, this can be solved by installing extension proxy switcher.
Once started proxy.sh, open proxy-switcher and select manual
Make sure HTTP proxy is set to 127.0.0.1 and Port 1080

Electron Apps might not respect system proxy, can be solved by using ClashX Pro
